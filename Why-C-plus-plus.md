# Why C++

I am not very good at C++ so why did I make this project in C++? One of the main reasons is because I wanted the language to match the language the engine Undertale was written in, was written in. GameMaker is written in C++ for the runtime, and C# for the IDE, but I don't feel like an IDE will be necessary.

It is always good to learn new languages. I have heard many things about how advanced C++ is, and I am willing to learn the language to write this project. I could have just written it in Python, but I don't want everything I make to be written in 1 programming language.

Plus, knowing that the original game was written in C++ it makes it so I can replicate the original game better.
